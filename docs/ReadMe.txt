The codes represent an ABM model that was developed as part of Zero Peak Energy Building Design for India (ZED-i) project. The work has been published in Scientific Reports and is available at https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-52676-2
This work has shown that significant reductions in peak loads are achievable through building-to-building load coordination within large networks. The theoretically optimal number of coordinating entities is surprisingly small and analogous to complex natural systems, whilst being network agnostic. These benefits are conferred in the presence of a very small information load at the level of an individual dwelling, i.e., the current load draw in the neighbourhood and the maximum “allowed”. This is in stark contrast to widely adopted DSM schemes that use optimisation techniques and are limited by their dependency on the availability of historical data and forecasts96,97. In the future, such coordination will no doubt become essential to manage the huge shifts currently underway in both the supply and demand side of the global energy system, i.e., increasing use of intermittent renewable generation and electricity as the only fuel for cars, space heating and space cooling. The agreement of the numerical simulation and experimental demonstration results is encouraging and strongly suggest that this type of local (or virtual peer-group) load distribution schemes are worth much further investigation.
